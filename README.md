# 2048-rl
===========

我的AI課程期末專題報告，用強化學習做一個2048遊戲代理人
現在只能用Q-learning來跑，之後會再補上DQN或者AC算法。
在終端下指令：`python main.py`就可以開始執行

My AI course final project, a reinforcement learning practice

I choose 2048 game as environment, which based on [2048-python](https://github.com/yangshun/2048-python) by yangshun, and I try to edit it to make it suit for RL env.

For now, I use [Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow) by MorvanZhou as the RL agent, it's only Q-learning now, I will try using DQN or AC algorithm to run it.

You can run `python main.py` to start the game.
